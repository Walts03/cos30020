        </li>
        <li>I did not fully completed the final task (Task 8), about creating the sort date function, I have succesfully display job from the most future closing date (means expired date job will not display on the result page). I cannot sort the result page properly.</li>
        <li>Beside the basic function provided in the pdf, I also completed the advance requirement for searchjobform.php and searchjobprocess.php, except the function for sorting the date to display it at result page properly.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Req 2. </b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>I have some problem accessing the PuTTy to get PHP version, but I saw the question has been answered by the tutor. And I also have some question about validation for closing date.
            And, I have complete lab work, watch tutorial classes and I think the meterial that has been provided by school has helped me fulfiled all the basic requirement in assignemnt 1. <br>
